These parts tend to curl off the bed. I recommend using a Raft in the slicer. Also I used a technique where I turn off the 
"Auto Drop to Build Plate" function and have the parts "hovering" a few mm above the bed with supports under it. 
Not only is the less solid support, less likely to warp, if it does, it's the support that compresses and not the model.
