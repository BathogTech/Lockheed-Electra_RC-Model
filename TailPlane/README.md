# Lockheed-Electra_RC-Model
Design, and build of a Radio Controlled Lockheed Electra L188, with mostly 3D printed parts.

Welcome to a Repo containing all the files for the 3D printed Electra RC model. The construction of which is well underway.
Refer to the BathoG Technologies YouTube channel for ongoing videos of the build process.
This Repo will have:-
1. Rescource material for the model. Photos, 3 Views, diagrams.
2. Blender 3D model files{.blend). showing the design of the parts.
3. (.STL) files exported from Blender for 3D printing. Also uploaded to Thingiverse.
4. Cura(.3mf) files showing how the STL files have been sliced for 3D Printing.
5. If required. The (.gcode) files suitable for the Anet A8 (Prusa i3) 3D printer.
6. Arduino sketches(.ino) for the programmable onboard electronics systems. Lights, undercarriage and Gear door sequencing.
7. Support documentation. Parts lists, key to parts, hardware schedules, build instructions, progress reports, etc.

This is an open Repo, and all issues and actions are welcome.
